# CogoDN Software Repository
CogoDN is an Coordinate Geometry framework for Civil Engineers (Roadway and Railway) and others needing horizontal and vertical alignments such as hydrologists and geomorphologists. It is implemented in Dot Net Core 3.x. 

Though the focus of CogoDN is alignment geometry this repository also includes a Triangulated Irregular Network (Tin model) for surface modelling. The Tin model may be instantiated from some types of Lidar, including the Lidar .las files available from the North Carolina Department of Public Safety. https://sdd.nc.gov/

Non-Association Disclaimer
Note Cogo has historically been the engineer's tool for Coordinate Geometry. CogoDN is in no way associated with the Coalition of Geospatial Organizations, which also uses the abbreviation, COGO. For the two names to be the same is a coindicence of history.
