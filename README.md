# CogoDN
CogoDN is an Coordinate Geometry framework for Civil Engineers (Roadway and Railway) in Dot Net. 

Though the focus of CogoDN is alignment geometry this repository also includes a Triangulated Irregular Network (Tin model) for surface modelling. The Tin model may be instantiated from some types of Lidar, including the Lidar .las files available from the North Carolina Department of Public Safety. https://sdd.nc.gov/

Note Cogo has historically been the engineer's tool for Coordinate Geometry. CogoDN is in no way associated with the Coalition of Geospatial Organizations, which also uses the abbreviation, COGO. For the two names to be the same is coindicence.
